Event Player Library
====================

This is a simple C# library for creating, applying and iterating through Events on Domain Driven Aggregates (and helping with type safety using generics).

When using this method for applying changes to my code I have a lot of options that are commonly seen in Event Store, CQRS, and other types distribution frameworks. But this doesn't look to add support for x brand database, communication protocol, etc. or bake in a lot of other functionality or features.

This library was created to keep things as light as possible and keeping things fairly type safe. Run the Tests and see what I mean!
